# DBConcurrency

This repository demonstrates how to handle database concurrency issues using Entity Framework Core. It provides practical examples of dealing with concurrent updates and handling conflicts in a multi-user environment. The project explores various concurrency control mechanisms offered by EF Core, such as optimistic concurrency, to ensure data consistency and integrity in applications.

## Features
- EF Core concurrency handling
- Conflict resolution techniques
- Optimistic concurrency implementation
